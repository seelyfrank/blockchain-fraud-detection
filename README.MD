# Blockchain Fraud Detection System
A fraud detection system that analyzes Ethereum blockchain transactions to identify potentially fraudulent activity. This project collects, stores, and analyzes 1M+ transactions using blockchain data science, machine learning, and SQL-based rule detection.

## Technical Skills Used
âœ” Blockchain Data Engineering â€“ Fetching transactions from Ethereum using ethers.js.
âœ” Database Management (SQL & MySQL) â€“ Storing blockchain transactions for structured analysis.
âœ” Data Analysis (Python, Pandas, SQL) â€“ Extracting insights from transaction data.
âœ” Machine Learning (Unsupervised Anomaly Detection) â€“ Detecting fraud without labeled data.
âœ” Full-Stack Development (Node.js, JavaScript) â€“ Backend integration with MySQL and blockchain.
âœ” Cloud & APIs (Alchemy, Infura) â€“ Fetching live blockchain data.
âœ” Big Data Handling â€“ Managing large datasets efficiently.
âœ” Data Visualization (Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn) â€“ Presenting fraud detection insights.

## Project Architecture
- Step 1: Collect Transactions

Retrieve transactions using ethers.js from Ethereum.
Store transactions in MySQL for structured querying.
- Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyze transaction volumes, wallet activity, and gas usage.
Identify high-value transactions and abnormal behavior.
- Step 3: Fraud Detection (Rules-Based & Machine Learning)

SQL-based heuristics to flag repetitive, high-value, or unusual transactions.
Unsupervised ML (Isolation Forest, DBSCAN) for anomaly detection.
- Step 4: Dashboard & Reporting

Visualizing fraud patterns in Power BI / Python Matplotlib.
Creating fraud detection reports for further investigation.
- Roadmap: Upcoming Features
